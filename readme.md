# Bootloader
This repository is a Sudoku game, coded in assembly language, and our purpose is to use the same mechanism used in a bootloader.  
It was developed for a Computing Engineering's course called Software Infraestructure, in the Federal University of Pernambuco - Brazil.

## How to Compile and Run
You need to be using a linux distribution to play this game. Just open the folder in your terminal and execute the following command:
  
	$ make

## How to Play
To solve the puzzle, you must fill in all the empty squares without using the same numeral twice in each column, row or box, and without changing the numerals that are already in the grid.

Good luck, and have fun!
